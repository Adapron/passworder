The program is a imitation of a login system and stores passwords in "data.json". All interactions with the user are through files in the "/languages" folder where it's possible to add a new file in the same format with any language and the application will automatically add this language to the list of possible languages.

The system can also work with email addresses and sends confirmation codes to the email for address verification and password resetting if necessary. All user information is encoded using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.
